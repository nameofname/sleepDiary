A little web site to help me (or anyone else) track my sleep habits.

// TODO !!! 
- I just re-factored the time view to add it to the summary view
- the instances of these should not have events, but should render with the proper display only
- so take eventing away, or make optional
- then put an edit link and create a new route where the diary row view will be displayed for editing. 
- then add in pagination.
